# TimeSeriesModeling
This is a project on time series modeling. We attempt to perform time series analysis on wind speed data and train a wind speed prediction model.

## Data 
Following dataset is used.https://opendata-renewables.engie.com/explore/dataset/01c55756-5cd6-4f60-9f63-2d771bb25a1a/information

## References:
We will pick the implementation ideas from the research publications at this link.
